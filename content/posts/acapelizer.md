### Acapelizer
####'The Lovechild Conceived Between Barbershop and Artificial Intelligence'

Hi folks! It might be a good idea to introduce you to my first project in a while: The Acapelizer!

'*What is this project?*', you may find yourself asking.

Well this project is aiming to take any song via MP3 or WAV input, and output a 4-part harmony, both in WAV and in MIDI, which would then export to sheet music for learning purposes. 

So far, for track splitting, this project uses [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter "Spleeter") to split the tracks, and is currently in progress. Check back for updates!
